                <h3>History of the Organization</h3>
            <p>Inspired by the historic market in District 1, which is unique for its quality of eating, people watching, and the fragrance of beautiful smelling food; Highlands sought to give this feeling of nostalgia and connection.<br>
            If we had to describe our cuisine in three words, we would choose: down-to-earth, honest and provocative. Down to earth, because here you can expect good old traditional street Vietnamese dishes and specialties from the Bến Thành Market. Honest, because we buy our ingredients from producers we know and trust, and some we even produce by ourselves. And if you want to know what makes Highlands provocative, you should come, and taste for yourself.
